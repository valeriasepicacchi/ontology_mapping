    "This document describes the experiments we performed on the RepoDB dataset. We created a feature set by extracting the direct and indirect paths between the drugs and the diseases from the Euretos Knowledge Platform. This is a generic knowledge graph, which contains information from almost 200 data sources. The features are created by counting the frequency of specific semantic types and semantic groups in the intermediate concepts of the drugs and diseases, as well as a binary feature which indicates whether there is a direct relationship between the drug and the disease.\n",

    "Based on this feature set, we try to recreate the “Approved” and “Terminated” classes of the RepoDB reference set (referred to in this document as “VALID” and “INVALID” or “positive” and “negative” respectively). Furthermore, we predict which drugs will be therapeutic for PKD. The experiments we performed for this investigation are described below."

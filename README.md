## ðŸ“˜ Thesis Summary

Ontology and taxonomy alignment is crucial for ensuring semantic interoperability across biomedical vocabularies. This thesis proposes a **supervised ensemble approach** that combines lexical, structural, and semantic features to improve equivalence mapping between concepts in heterogeneous biomedical ontologies.

The proposed pipeline:
- Extracts concept labels and embeddings
- Generates candidate pairs using a hybrid similarity strategy
- Builds features (e.g., lexical, embedding-based, hierarchical)
- Trains an **ensemble classifier** (Voting: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest)
- Evaluates performance against state-of-the-art systems (BERTMap, LogMap, Matcha-DL, etc.)

The method is evaluated on the **Bio-ML track datasets** from the [Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI)](http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/).

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

Three biomedical ontology pairs are used:

- **NCITâ€“DOID**: Cancer vs. general disease ontologies  
- **OMIMâ€“ORDO**: Genetic vs. rare disease ontologies  
- **SNOMEDâ€“FMA**: Clinical terminology vs. anatomy
